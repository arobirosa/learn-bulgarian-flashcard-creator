## Advantages

You can study your own vocabulary with your own English translations using [Ankiweb](https://ankiweb.net/). You can focus on only learning the irregular forms of the nouns, adjectives, adverbs and verbs.

## Features

* Generates flashcards for your own vocabulary. You can choose what words are important for you
* It generates additional flashcards for the irregular forms of the word
* Searches for the translation in English on [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/translator) and [PONS's online dictionary](https://en.pons.com/translate/bulgarian-english/) and you can modify and extend those translations
* Stores the flashcards in a database which you can modify manually using the [SQLite Database Browser](https://sqlitebrowser.org/)

## Limitations

* Only irregular forms which are in the [grammar dictionary](https://rechnik.chitanka.info/w) are identified
* You have to enter your own vocabulary. If you want to spare time by creating the deck, you can use [Ankiweb's decks with Bulgarian vocabulary](https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks?search=bulgarian)
